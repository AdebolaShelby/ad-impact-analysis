# Ad Channel Impact Analysis

## Project Overview
A comprehensive statistical analysis examining the relationships between Paid Search advertising and other marketing channels, with a focus on potential cannibalization effects on Organic Search performance.

## Key Findings üìä

### Channel Correlations with PPC Spend
| Channel | Correlation | Interpretation |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| Paid Search | 0.82 | Strong Positive |
| Cross-network | 0.46 | Moderate Positive |
| Organic Search | 0.31 | Moderate Positive |
| Direct Traffic | 0.28 | Weak Positive |
| Organic Shopping | 0.25 | Weak Positive |
| Organic Social | 0.22 | Weak Positive |

### Major Insights
- **No Cannibalization Effect**: Data shows no evidence of Paid Search cannibalizing Organic Search traffic
- **Complementary Relationships**: Channels demonstrate supportive rather than competitive behavior
- **Positive Impact**: PPC spending shows positive correlation with all analyzed channels

## Technical Implementation üõ†Ô∏è

### Data Processing Pipeline
1. **Campaign Performance Data**
   - Removed redundant columns (Currency, CTR, CPC)
   - Standardized date formats
   - Normalized temporal data

2. **Google Analytics (GA4) Data**
   - Created temporal components (Year, Month, Day)
   - Channel-based aggregation
   - Filtered to core channels:
     - Organic Search
     - Paid Search
     - Direct

### Analysis Methodology
- **Time Frame**: 2023-2024
- **Statistical Approach**: Correlation analysis with visualization
- **Channel Focus**: Primary traffic sources only
- **Data Quality**: Filtered for consistency and completeness
